## Performance Testing Plan

### 1. Introduction
Performance testing is crucial to ensure that a network application, such as the provided Python chat server, can handle the expected load and provide a responsive user experience. This testing plan outlines the steps to be taken to perform performance testing on the given Python chat server implemented using socket programming.

### 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of the performance testing are:
- Evaluate the server's responsiveness under various loads.
- Identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues.
- Assess the application's ability to handle multiple simultaneous connections.

### 3. Testing Environment
The testing will be conducted in a controlled environment using the following setup:
- Server machine: The machine where the chat server is deployed.
- Client machine(s): Machines simulating multiple clients connecting to the server.
- Network: A stable and reliable network connection.

### 4. Performance Testing Steps

#### a. Test Scenarios
1. **Baseline Test:** Evaluate server performance with a moderate load (e.g., 10 simultaneous connections).
2. **Stress Test:** Assess server behavior under high load conditions (e.g., 100 simultaneous connections).
3. **Scalability Test:** Measure the server's ability to handle increased loads by gradually increasing the number of connections.

#### b. Metrics to Measure
1. **Response Time:** Measure the time taken for the server to respond to a client request.
2. **Throughput:** Evaluate the number of successful transactions (connections, messages) per unit of time.
3. **Concurrency:** Assess the number of simultaneous connections the server can handle without degradation.
4. **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage on the server machine.

#### c. Test Tools
- **Locust:** Use Locust, an open-source load testing tool, to simulate multiple concurrent users and gather performance metrics.

#### d. Testing Procedure
1. **Baseline Test:**
   - Configure Locust to simulate 10 concurrent users.
   - Monitor response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
   - Record results.

2. **Stress Test:**
   - Configure Locust to simulate 100 concurrent users.
   - Gradually increase the load until the server reaches its limit.
   - Monitor response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
   - Record results.

3. **Scalability Test:**
   - Gradually increase the number of concurrent users in Locust.
   - Monitor server behavior and identify the point of performance degradation.
   - Record results.

### 5. Test Suite Implementation

#### a. Locust Test Script
```python
from locust import HttpUser, between, task

class ChatUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)

    @task
    def send_message(self):
        self.client.post("/send_message", json={"message": "Test message"})

    # Add more tasks as needed for specific functionalities

# Run the test using the following command:
# locust -f locust_test_script.py --headless -u 10 -r 2 -t 1m
```

#### b. Running the Test
- Save the above Locust test script to a file, e.g., `locust_test_script.py`.
- Run Locust using the provided command, specifying the number of users (`-u`), hatch rate (`-r`), and test duration (`-t`).

### 6. Results and Analysis
- Document the results obtained from each test scenario, including response time, throughput, concurrency, and resource utilization.
- Analyze any performance issues, bottlenecks, or areas of improvement.
- Provide recommendations for optimizing the application based on the test findings.

### 7. Conclusion
Summarize the key findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for improving the performance of the Python chat server.
